> The joyful oceanographic seagoing expedition planning helper

Dreamcoat is a set of tools to help work with oceanographic data of the sort that might be needed before, during and after a research expedition.

Dreamcoat is being developed by [Dr Matthew Humphreys](https://hseao3.group) at the NIOZ Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research, Texel.  You're very welcome to give it a go and suggestions and contributions are welcome, but please be aware that it is primarily designed as a personal tool, so I probably won't be able to help out if you get stuck; nothing is guaranteed not to break between versions, and the documentation (which is entirely written into docstrings within the package itself) may be incomplete or out of date.
