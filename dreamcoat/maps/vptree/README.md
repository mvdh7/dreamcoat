# vptree

This module within dreamcoat has been copied in its entirety from Rickard Sj√∂gren's vptree v1.3, specifically, from the master branch of the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/RickardSjogren/vptree) on 15 October 2024.

This has been done so that dreamcoat can be added to conda-forge (as vptree is only available on PyPI).

The original MIT license of vptree is provided in this directory and it should be compatible with dreamcoat's GPL-3.0.

## Changes made in dreamcoat.maps.vptree

Other than restyling with black, no changes have been made from the original package.
