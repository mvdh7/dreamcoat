# great_circle_calculator

This module within dreamcoat has been copied in its entirety from Sean Grogan's great_circle_calculator v1.3.1, specifically, from the master branch of the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/seangrogan/great_circle_calculator) on 15 October 2024.

This has been done so that dreamcoat can be added to conda-forge (as great_circle_calculator is only available on PyPI).

The original MIT license of great_circle_calculator is provided in this directory and it should be compatible with dreamcoat's GPL-3.0.

## Changes made in dreamcoat.great_circle_calculator

Other than restyling with black, no changes have been made from the original package.
